# Product-Token-Handbook
A collection of half finished thoughts about product tokenization for the purposes of track and trace across industries and regions.  These are my own opinions (build on the great ideas and explanations of my peers) and are subject to change over time.  PLEASE DO treat everything here as a draft and leave comments/corrections as you see fit.

## Disclaimer
I am fortunate that as a principal at EY I have the opportunity to contribute to thought leadership in collaboration with my amazing colleagues – that process represents the collective point of view of EY.

I am doubly fortunate to be able to write articles and guidance documents through my role with the International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineers (ISPE) as part of the global GAMP steering committee and as the leader of the GAMP Blockchain Special Interest Group.  Again with the help of my mentors and the editorial staff those knowledge pieces represent topics that would be of interest to readers of PE Magazine and we strive to find the right balance of technical depth and general understanding.

This repo is my place to make mistakes and go on-record doing so.  I sometimes look back at my old notes/ramblings and realize that I might had been into something if only I had talked about it sooner.  I also look at the things that I got wrong, and wish someone could have corrected my thinking earlier.

So this site is not me being selfish or me trying to make a land-grab on ideas – it is a sounding board and a call for collaboration.  I’m posting things out here that are admittedly half baked and I can’t emphasize enough that these are solely my own opinions; that’s not to say that these are my own ideas – it is often after in-depth conversations with people far smarter than I, that a lightbulb goes off.  When things click for me I write so that I can process and understand further.

I also apologize in advance for the poor editing – many of these were drafted on my phone, in between meetings or events or whenever I could grab a few quite minutes.  I do edit them at least once, but they are certainly not polished… to that end I promise this is me and not an AI copilot.

So I hope you can find something of value in here – maybe it makes your wheels turn a bit.  Please please point out when it’s apparent that I don’t know what I’m talking about.  I’ve left the comments section anonymous so that others can speak their minds (though I do reserve the right to edit/delete comments if they are detractive from my goal of collaborative exploration – in other words be nice or I will delete you).
