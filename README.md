# Product-Token-Handbook
A collection of half finished thoughts about product tokenization for the purposes of track and trace across industries and regions.  These are my own opinions (build on the great ideas and explanations of my peers) and are subject to change over time.  PLEASE DO treat everything here as a draft and leave comments/corrections as you see fit.
