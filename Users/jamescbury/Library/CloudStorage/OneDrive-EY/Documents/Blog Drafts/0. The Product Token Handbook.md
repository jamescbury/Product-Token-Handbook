This is a culmination of multiple thinkings about how we will use blockchains to manage global supply chains through the use of product tokens.  The basics are pretty simple: a token represents a thing, a wallet represents a person or an entity, when a token is in a persons wallet that person has a claim on the thing.  We can mint (create) tokens, transfer (move), and burn (destroy or lock) tokens; we can also "sign metadata" against a token which is just a fancy way of saying we can generate some information about the token, sign it with a digital signature, and later reproduce it in a way that we can prove we didn't change anything) - each of these things is called a transaction.  The transactions build on each other in a time series, the most reset of transactions for a given token define it's "current state" and the complete set of transactions for token are its "history".  We do these things on a blockchain because blockchains are the best way to get everyone in agreement about

"Product token" is a generic term used to refer to a digital identifier of a physical asset.  The term "token" is fitting description in that it is defined as "something serving as in indication, proof or expression of something else; a sign" or "something that signifies or evidences authority, validity or identity".  But the term "token" is also confusing because we are talking about using tokens on a network, and "network tokens" are quite different.  The truth is we call the "tokens" because
